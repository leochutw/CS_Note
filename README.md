# CS_Note
My personal notes on Computer Science Topics, particularly on Unix/Linux OS.
Marvellous...  Editing in Codespace is actually very easy with Codespace app on Samsung DeX, ...  Just be careful when using Chinese Input on my Android phone.  Super convenient.


## I want to test multiple commits in my local Surface7_leochu branch will be squashed into one commit in the final merge to the master
### This is commit 1
### This is commit 2
### This is commit 3

This Surface7_leochu should not exist on my github page after I've merged it and delete it, hwoever, `git branch -a` on my local machine still shows this remote origin branch.  Maybe it was not totally deleted.


Latest Update on README.md from github webpage directly.

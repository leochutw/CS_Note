Selection Guide for Online MarkDown Editor

# Background
I am in love with markdown language, particularly for my note-taking and perhaps for my blogger posts too.  Initially I was writing markdown files that stored on my local hard-drive which works well until I started to use multiple machines, particularly with virtual machines.  I started to think about storing all my notes online and assess them everywhere there is internet, and perhaps share my notes to whomever find them useful.  Anyway, I looked at [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/), [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/), and finally back to [github](https://github.com) again.  I was pondering between HackMD and StackEdit for a while, since they offer real-time MarkDown Rendering directly in the web-browser which is great as a new-comer to MarkDown language.  BUT at the end, I choose github due to its ability to search within all my markdown notes which is imperative for my dialy need.  Another advantage on using github is the media files reference in the markdown note can also be stored in github too.

**NOTE**: if you want to create personal private notes, then github will not be good idea.  Private repository cannot be searched.

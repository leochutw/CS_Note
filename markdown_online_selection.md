Selection Guide for Online MarkDown Editor

# Background
I am in love with markdown language, particularly for my note-taking and blogger posts sometimes.  Initially I used to write markdown files and stored it on my local machine with git archive which works well until I started to use multiple machines, particularly with virtual machines.  I start to think about storing all my notes online and assess them everywhere there is internet, and perhaps share my notes to whomever find it useful.  Anyway, I looked at [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/), [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/), and finally back to [github](https://github.com) again.  I was pondering between HackMD and StackEdit for a while, since they offer real-time MarkDown Rendering directly in the web-browser which is great for a new-comer to MarkDown language.  BUT at the end, I choose github due to its ability to search within all my markdown notes.  I really cannot live without 'search' feature.  Another advantage on using github is the media files reference in the markdown note can also be stored in github too.

**NOTE**: if you want to create personal private notes, then github will not be good idea.  Private repository cannot be searched.

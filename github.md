This is a change I made from MS-Windows machine on github desktop.

## Change made on github web directly... so my local 'Surface7' branch is falling behind the latest master.



## github search
I intend to store my notes in my github account, lots of notes will be made and searching within this note repository becomes imperative, particularly MarkDown files are pure text.  Fortunately `github` allows users to search (clikc on top left corner on the github page) all public repositories so that I can recall the information I've recorded down.  *NOTE*(update 2022): github.dev integrates VSCode onto web which makes online code/MarkDown editing much easier.

Please refer to github's documentation on [search on github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github) and [about search](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github).

Anyway, at the end I have narrowed down the advanced search to my own personal repository and embedded it into my customzied Chrome Search Engine

**IMPORTANT**: Search within github really makes my life easier.  I no longer have to clone the repository into my local machine and `grep` through the files.

## github desktop
This is a GUI tool for `git` command for GitHub.  It's similiar to Altanssian's [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).  Something easy yet intutive for first time user, however, `git` command is still more powerful.

This is a change I made from MS-Windows machine on github desktop.



## github search
I've got quite a lot of information in my github account, so searching within my repositories will be useful, particularly on Markdown files I've written.  Fortunately github allows users to search all public repositories, but I just need to search within my own repositories to recall my memory from my markdown notes.

Please refer to github's documentation on [search on github](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github) and [about search](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github).

Anyway, at the end I have narrowed down the advanced search to my own personal repository and embedded it into my customzied Chrome Search Engine

**IMPORTANT**: Search within github really makes my life easier.  I no longer have to clone the repository into my local machine and `grep` through the files.

## github deskopt
This is a GUI tool for `git` command for GitHub.  It's similiar to Altanssian's [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).  Something easy yet intutive for first time user, however, `git` command is still more powerful.

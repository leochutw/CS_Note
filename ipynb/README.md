# Background
I just realized that you can create Jupyter/IPyhtonNotebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) which can link to github.  Bravo.

## ipynb on binder
This is probably the most convenient way of creating ipynb on the cloud. (Better than Google colab).
